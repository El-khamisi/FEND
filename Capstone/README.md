# Travel APP

## Overview
The project will include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. 

## Extend Options / Ways to Stand Out

* Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API.
* Allow user to add multiple destinations on the same trip.
* Allow the user to remove the trip.

## This runs on localhost:8081, but you can of course edit that in server.js
